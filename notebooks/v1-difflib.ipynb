    "cried--she was a most offensive child--\"why will they not\n",
    "discuss this most clear question?\"  Her father, surveying\n",
    "the parties grimly, replied that he did not know.  Putting\n",

    "two things is very clear; either God does not know his own\n",

    "the mind of God.\" A hateful little girl, but at thirteen she\n",
    "had grasped a dilemma that most people travel through life\n",
    "without perceiving.  Her brain darted up and down; it grew\n",
    "pliant and strong.  Her conclusion was, that any human being\n",
